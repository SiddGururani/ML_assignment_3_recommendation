# Recommendation System

A Non-negative Matrix Factorization based recommendation system. Evaluation based on RMSE error on the training data. Assignment is evaluated on a separate test dataset not available.

Grid search was performed for best parameters but time constraint was given high priority. Slower grid search to allow for run-times of greater than 3 minutes might yield lower traininst RMSE.
